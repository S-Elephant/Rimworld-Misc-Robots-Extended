	<description>Added a settings menu for Misc Robots++ so you can configure the hp of the basestations of the robots. You can even mess with the settings during live-play.

No longer do you have to worry about your expensive robots getting destroyed by a tiny pebble. Adjust them all to your needs.
	
Technical details:	
- Mod is C# only. Source is included.
- Can safely be added to an existing game. Your current higher tier basestations may require repairs (one-time only).
- Can safely be removed from an existing game.
- Is translation-ready.
- Requires the Misc Robots 1.1 and Misc Robots++ 1.1 mods loaded before this mod.
- Doesn't drain any performance during play.</description>
